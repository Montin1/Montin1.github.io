			<p4>I love being in nature so this video was inspired by that but 
				also the fact that when people visit national parks or nature in 
				general they completely ignore that they are walking into a place t
				hat is home to many animals and the ignorance that some be have that they feel that they are the dominiant being so they can do and act how ever they want where ever they please. My intention with this piece was to create awareness that to respect all the creature that co-exist with us in this planet. </p4>
